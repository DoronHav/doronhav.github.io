I am Doron (means gift in Hebrew), a PhD candidate at the [Dana Pe'er Lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, through Cornell University's Tri-Institutional PhD program in Computational Biology. My research mainly revovles around optimal transport & spatial transcriptomics. 

Before that, I studied Physics and Electrical Engineering at Technion, and graduated with two degrees in 2018. My undergraduate thesis was published at [ICML2019](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/haviv19a.html)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
